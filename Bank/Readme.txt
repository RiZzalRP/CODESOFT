 Bank Customer Churn Analysis with Machine Learning! ðŸ’¡

In my latest project, I explored customer churn prediction using various machine learning models, focusing on classifying whether a customer will leave a bank based on historical data.

Key Highlights:
Dataset: Customer demographics, banking activity, and behavioral data.
Objective: Predict the Exited column (whether a customer leaves the bank).
Steps I Followed:
Data Exploration & Cleaning:

Analyzed categorical features like Geography, Gender, Credit Score, and more.
Visualized data distributions with seaborn and plotly.
Cleaned the dataset by removing unnecessary columns.
Preprocessing:

Label encoding for categorical variables (e.g., Geography, Gender).
Feature scaling with StandardScaler for improved model performance.
Models Applied:

Logistic Regression: A classic approach for churn analysis, providing interpretable results.
Decision Tree Classifier: A non-linear model to capture complex relationships.
Random Forest Classifier: Used 100 decision trees for improved accuracy and robustness.
Gradient Boosting Classifier: Applied boosting to optimize predictions with a learning rate of 0.1.
Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports to assess performance.
5-fold cross-validation for reliable evaluation.
Results:
Models performed well, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting showing strong predictive power. ðŸ’ª
This project highlights the importance of feature engineering, data cleaning, and model tuning for predicting customer behavior in the financial domain.
Tools used: Python, sklearn, seaborn, plotly

ðŸ‘‰ Always excited to explore new ways to improve model performance and customer insights!
