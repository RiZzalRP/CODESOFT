Credit Card Fraud Detection with Machine Learning ðŸ’³ðŸ’»

In this project, I built machine learning models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using real-world datasets. This is a vital application of data science, helping to secure financial systems from fraud.

Project Highlights:
Dataset: A combination of train and test data with features such as transaction details, merchant info, and demographic data.
Objective: Classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent (is_fraud).
Key Steps:
Data Exploration & Cleaning:

Analyzed the dataset for missing values, duplicated rows, and categorical distributions.
Removed unnecessary columns like names, addresses, and transaction numbers to focus on relevant features.
Data Preprocessing:

Label Encoding: Converted categorical features (e.g., gender, category, merchant) into numeric format.
Train-Test Split: Used an 80/20 split for training and testing.
Data Visualization:

Plotted gender and category distributions to understand customer demographics and transaction types.
Visualized correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between numeric features.
Models Built:

Logistic Regression: A baseline model with fast training and interpretability.
Decision Tree Classifier: A model capturing non-linear relationships.
Random Forest Classifier: Built an ensemble of 100 trees to improve prediction accuracy.
Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy: Measured how well models classified fraudulent transactions.
Confusion Matrix: Visualized false positives and false negatives.
Classification Reports: Evaluated precision, recall, and F1-scores.
Cross-Validation: Used 5-fold cross-validation to ensure reliable performance.
Results:
The Random Forest Classifier outperformed other models in detecting fraud with high accuracy and stability. ðŸŒŸ
This project demonstrates how machine learning models can enhance fraud detection and reduce financial losses in the banking sector.
